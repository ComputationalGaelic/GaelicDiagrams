Gaelic Diagrams
===============

A set of diagrams depicting grammar, word formation and spelling rules for Scottish Gaelic.

The diagrams are created using GraphViz:  
https://graphviz.org

To render a diagram use something like:  
```
dot -Tpng filename.dot -o outputname.png
```

At present this project is in the very early stages and the diagrams should not be treated as authoritative.
