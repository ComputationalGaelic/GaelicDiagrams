Case: *Tuiseal*

.. index:: case

Gaelic has four grammatical cases: nominative, dative, genitive and vocative. These determine the form that a noun may take in different contexts.

The **nominative case** is the most basic case. It is used when naming or identifying something, and when a noun is the subject or object of a verb. The standard spelling or root form of a noun, such as you find it in a dictionary, is given the in nominative case.

The **dative case** is used when a noun follows a simple preposition, such as *aig*, *air*, *ann* or *ro* and *tro*. The spelling and pronunciation of a noun will often change when it takes the dative case. The dative is also known as the prepositional case.

The **genitive case** is used when one noun has a direct relationship to another usually in the form of belonging to the other noun. This is often expressed through a possessive pronoun such as ‘my’ or ‘your’, i.e. *mo mhàthair* (my mother), or when used in a genitive construct, i.e. *ceann na rathaid* (the end of the road). The spelling and pronunciation of a noun will often change when it takes the genitive case.

The **vocative case** is used when directly addressing someone by name. The spelling and pronunciation of a name will change when given in the vocative.


The transformation of a noun across the different cases is most evident when it has the definite article. In it's most general sense, the transformation can be seen as a process of gradual softening as a word changes from nominative to dative and then genitive. The gender of the noun is also significant. Each of the cases is described in greater detail below.


Nominative Case: *Tuiseal Ainmneach*
------------------------------------

.. index:: case, nominative

The nominative case is the basic, root form of the noun. It is used when the noun is either the subject or direct object of a sentence, such as when identifying something and talking directly about someone or something. Example phrases are:

===================== ===================
Gaelic                English
===================== ===================
*botal*               a bottle
*am botal*            the bottle
*Tha botal seo gorm*  This bottle is blue
*Bhris am botal*      The bottle broke
===================== ===================

As the root form of a noun, the nominative is the basis from which words are transformed when they change case or quantity.

When taking the definite article, masculine nouns do not change in the nominative case except for those beginning with a vowel. These are preceded by a *t-* in the definite form:

====================== ==========================
Indefinite             Definite
====================== ==========================
*aran* (bread)         *an t-aran* (the bread)
*eilean* (island)      *an t-eilean* (the island)
*iasg* (fish)          *an t-iasg* (the fish)
*òran* (song)          *an t-òran* (the song)
*ubhal* (apple)        *an t-ubhal* (the apple)
====================== ==========================

When feminine nouns take the definite article, these all lenite where possible:

====================== ==========================
Indefinite             Definite
====================== ==========================
*bò* (cow)             *a’ bhò* (the cow)
*cluas* (ear)          *a’ chluas* (the ear)
*feòil* (meat)         *a’ fheòil* (the meat)
*gruag* (hair)         *a’ ghruag* (the hair)
*mil* (honey)          *a’ mhil* (the honey)
*poit* (pot)           *a’ phoit* (the pot)
*sùil* (eye)           *a’ shùil* (the eye)

Dative Case: *Tuiseal Tabhartach*
---------------------------------

.. index:: case, dative

A noun takes the dative case when it follows a simple preposition. The simple propositions that require the dative case are:

===================== =========================
Gaelic                English
===================== =========================
*à*                   out of (from a place)
*aig*                 at
*air*                 on
*ann an*              in
*bho*                 from someone or something
*de*                  of (part of, some of)
*do*                  to, for
*fo*                  under
*gu*                  to, until
*le*                  with
*mu*                  about
*ri*                  against, with
*ro*                  before
*tro*                 through

Vocative Case: *Tuiseal Gairmeach*
----------------------------------

.. index:: case, vocative

The vocative case is used when directly addressing someone or, less commonly, something. In older English, such as that of the *King James Bible*, the vocative case is shown explicitly by preceding a name or pronoun phrase with the vocative article **o** as in a phrase such as “O ye of little faith.” When calling someone by name this would be something like “O James.” In modern English the use of **o** has dropped but the vocative form is implicit in a sentence such as “I don’t know, James” where the comma serves to indicate that someone called James is being addressed directly. In this example I am telling James that I do not know something. This distinguishes it from “I don’t know James” which would mean that I do not know someone called James.

The vocative case remains explicit in Gaelic with **a** used as the vocative article. When a name is given in the vocative case it change sin spelling and pronunciation. This varies depending on the gender of the name. Masculine names lenite at the beginning and slenderise at the end. *Seumas* (James) becomes *Sheumais* and would be preceded with the vocative article: *a Sheumais*. Feminine names lenite at the beginning but do not slenderise. *Màiri* (Mary) becomes *Mhàiri* or *a Mhàiri* with the vocative article.

The phrase “I don’t know, James” would therefore become *Chan eil fios agam, a Sheumais*. “Morning, Mary!” would be *Madainn mhath, a Mhàiri!*. The phrase “I don’t know James” however would not be *Chan eil fios agam Seumas* as Gaelic uses a different construct for such phrases and this form is idiomatic to English. The Gaelic for “I don’t know James” would be *Chan aithnich mi Seumas*.

Names and nouns beginning with *l*, *n*, and *r* do not show lenition when written, i.e. *Madainn mhath, a Raghnaid!* (Morning, Rachel!). For those that begin with a vowel, such as *Aonghas* or *Ùna*, the vocative article is dropped. Feminine names in these instances appear unchanged whereas masculine name swill still slenderise: *Madainn mhath, Aonghais!* and *Madainn mhath, Ùna!*
