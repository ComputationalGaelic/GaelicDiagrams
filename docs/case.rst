.. index:: case

Gaelic has four grammatical cases: nominative, dative, genitive and vocative. These determine the form that a noun may take in different contexts.

The **nominative case** is the most basic case. It is used when naming or identifying something, and when a noun is the subject or object of a verb. The standard spelling or root form of a noun, such as you find it in a dictionary, is given the in nominative case.

The **dative case** is used when a noun follows a simple preposition, such as *aig*, *air*, *ann* or *ro* and *tro*. The spelling and pronunciation of a noun will often change when it takes the dative case. The dative is also known as the prepositional case.

The **genitive case** is used when one noun has a direct relationship to another usually in the form of belonging to the other noun. This is often expressed through a possessive pronoun such as ‘my’ or ‘your’, i.e. *mo mhàthair* (my mother), or when used in a genitive construct, i.e. *ceann na rathaid** (the end of the road). The spelling and pronunciation of a noun will often change when it takes the genitive case.

The **vocative case** is used when directly addressing someone by name. The spelling and pronunciation of a name will change when given in the vocative.
