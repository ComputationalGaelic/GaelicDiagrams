The Gaelic Alphabet: *Aibidil*
------------------------------

.. index:: alphabet

The *aibidil*, the Gaelic alphabet, consists of 18 letters, the five vowels and thirteen consonants: b, c, d, f, g, h, l, m, n, p, r, s, t. Traditionally, the letters of the Gaelic alphabet are each identified with a specific tree whose name relates to the sound of the letter.

Vowel Groups: *Caol ri Caol ’s Leathann ri Leathann*
----------------------------------------------------

.. index:: vowels

Vowels in Gaelic divide into two groups: the *broad* vowels -- a, o, u -- and the *slender* vowels -- e, i.

.. graphviz:: ../gaelic_diagrams/spelling/vowel_groups.dot
	:caption: The broad and slender vowel groups.

In spelling a word, the vowels on either side of a consonant will normally be from the same group. This rule is known as *Caol ri Caol ’s Leathann ri Leathann* -- Broad with Broad and Slender with Slender -- and is one of the most basic spelling rules governing the language.

.. graphviz:: ../gaelic_diagrams/spelling/vowels_broad_slender.dot
	:caption: *Caol ri Caol ’s Leathann ri Leathann*.

There are some exceptions to this as when the emphatic endings, *sa*, *-se* and *esan*, are applied: **example**.

And a few words such as *rudeigin* (something) but this is an anomaly that has arisen from what was originally two separate words joined by a hyphen, *rud-eigin*, becoming fused as a single item. This separation can be seen in related terms such as *tè-eigin* (some woman).

Vowels also appear in *short* and *long* forms. The short form of a vowels is written as the letter on its own -- a, e,i,o,u -- and the long form as the letter with an accent known as a *stràc* written over it ---- à, è, ì, ò, ù.

Consonant Groups
----------------

.. index:: consonants

Gaelic does not require all of the consonants of the standard Latin alphabet. The letters j, k, q, v, w, x, y and z are not used.  

.. graphviz:: ../gaelic_diagrams/spelling/gaelic_consonants.dot
	:caption: Gaelic consonants.

The consonants can be divided into different groups related to pronunciation and spelling rules.

.. graphviz:: ../gaelic_diagrams/spelling/consonant_groups.dot
	:caption: Gaelic consonants.

The main division is determined by *lenition*, a pronunciation change through which certain consonants are softened. There are two main groups within those consonants that lenite, those that take the letter ‘h’ and those that do not. The group ‘sg sm sp st’ do not lenite at all. The letter ‘h’ is effectively a group in itself as it is never used as a letter on its own in Gaelic. Lenition is described in greater detail below. 

A smaller distinction lies with the group ‘b f m p’. When these letters are found at the start of a word and are preceded by the definite article or a connective that ends in ‘n’, the ‘n’ becomes ‘m’ -- *an* becomes *am* and *gun* becomes *gum*. This is also described in greater detail below.

Slenderising: *caoileachadh*
----------------------------

.. index:: slenderising

Certain consonants in Gaelic will change in pronunciation depending on whether they are accompanied by a broad or slender vowel. **examples**

Words ending with broad vowels will sometimes change to ending with a slender vowel for grammatical reasons. For example, *balach*, the singular for boy, will become *balaich* in the plural. This change is known as slenderising (*caoileachadh*). It may take the form of a slender vowel being added to the existing vowels of the final syllable, as in *balaich*, or in the vowels changing completely, such as *eun*, for bird, which becomes *eòin* in the plural. As well as when certain nouns become plural, slenderising can also happen when a man’s name is used in the Vocative Case, i.e. *Dòmhnall* becomes *a Dhòmhnaill*, or for nouns used in the Genitive Case as when *cas*, foot, becomes *coise* as in *ball-coise*, football.
