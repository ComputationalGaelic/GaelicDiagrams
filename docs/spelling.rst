Vowel Groups: *Caol ri Caol ’s Leathann ri Leathann*
----------------------------------------------------

Vowels in Gaelic divide into two groups: the *broad* vowels -- a, o, u -- and the *slender* vowels -- e, i.

**diagram**

In a word, the vowels on either side of a consonant will normally be from the same group. This rule is known as *Caol ri Caol ’s Leathann ri Leathann* -- Broad with Broad and Slender with Slender -- and is one of the most basic spelling rules governing the language.

There are some exceptions to this as when the emphatic endings, *sa*, *-se* and *esan*, are applied: **example**.

And a few words such as *rudeigin* (something) but this is an anomaly that has arisen from what was originally two separate words joined by a hyphen, *rud-eigin*, becoming fused as a single item. This separation can be seen in related terms such as *tè-eigin* (some woman).
