The Gaelic Alphabet: *Aibidil*
------------------------------

.. index:: alphabet

The *aibidil*, the Gaelic alphabet, consists of 18 letters, the five vowels and thirteen consonants: b, c, d, f, g, h, l, m, n, p, r, s, t. Traditionally, the letters of the Gaelic alphabet are each identified with a specific tree whose name relates to the sound of the letter.

Vowel Groups: *Caol ri Caol ’s Leathann ri Leathann*
----------------------------------------------------

.. index:: vowels

Vowels in Gaelic divide into two groups: the *broad* vowels -- a, o, u -- and the *slender* vowels -- e, i.

.. graphviz:: ../gaelic_diagrams/spelling/vowel_groups.dot
	:caption: The broad and slender vowel groups.

In spelling a word, the vowels on either side of a consonant will normally be from the same group. This rule is known as *Caol ri Caol ’s Leathann ri Leathann* -- Broad with Broad and Slender with Slender -- and is one of the most basic spelling rules governing the language.

.. graphviz:: ../gaelic_diagrams/spelling/vowels_broad_slender.dot
	:caption: *Caol ri Caol ’s Leathann ri Leathann*.

There are some exceptions to this as when the emphatic endings, *sa*, *-se* and *esan*, are applied: **example**.

And a few words such as *rudeigin* (something) but this is an anomaly that has arisen from what was originally two separate words joined by a hyphen, *rud-eigin*, becoming fused as a single item. This separation can be seen in related terms such as *tè-eigin* (some woman).

Vowels also appear in *short* and *long* forms. The short form of a vowels is written as the letter on its own -- a, e,i,o,u -- and the long form as the letter with an accent known as a *stràc* written over it -- à, è, ì, ò, ù.

Consonant Groups
----------------

.. graphviz:: ../gaelic_diagrams/spelling/gaelic_consonants.dot
	:caption: Gaelic consonants.

Gaelic does not require all of the consonants of the standard Latin alphabet. The letters j, k, q, v, w, x, y and z are not used.  

The consonants can be divided into different groups related to pronunciation and spelling rules.

The main division is determined by *lenition*, a pronunciation change through which certain consonants are softened. There are two main groups within those consonants that lenite, those that take the letter **h** and those that do not. The group **sg sm sp st** do not lenite at all. The letter **h** is effectively a group in itself as it is never used as a letter on its own in Gaelic. Lenition is described in greater detail below. 

A smaller distinction lies with the group **b f m p**. When these letters are found at the start of a word and are preceded by the definite article or a connective that ends in **n**, the **n** becomes **m** -- *an* becomes *am* and *gun* becomes *gum*. This is also described in greater detail below.

Phoneme Groups: *Fuaimean*
--------------------------

Gaelic can also be divided up into distinct phoneme groups. These form the most common building blocks for Gaelic words.

B, F, M and P: *An* to *Am*
---------------------------

.. index:: an to am

For words beginning with the letters **b**, **f**, **m** or **p**, the forms of the definite article and certain prepositions and conjunctions that end with the letter **n** are altered to end with **m**. These are *an*, *gun* and *nan* which become *am*, *gum* and *nam*. The specific form of the definite article can also change depending on the gender and case of the noun. These cases are covered in the chapter on nouns.

Lenition: *Sèimheachadh*
------------------------

.. index:: lenition

Lenition is the change in pronunciation through which certain consonants are softened. It is a very characteristic feature of Gaelic and, like slenderising, often denotes important grammatical changes. In the Vocative Case, for example, the first consonant of a name is lenited. This applies to both male and female names, so that *Seumas* becomes *Sheamuis* and *Màiri* becomes *Mhàiri*. Notice that in *Sheamuis* the final vowel has also become slenderised. This is where the Anglicised names such as “Hamish” and “Mhairi” come from, neither of which are strictly correct Gaelic.

Lenition is most commonly shown by adding an **h** to the lenited consonant, as in: *bh*, *ch*, *dh*, *fh*, *gh*, *mh*, *ph*, *sh*, *th*. The letters **l** and **n** can also be lenited but this is not shown in writing.

Whilst the letter **s** on its own can be lenited, it is not lenited when followed by g, m, p or t, so that the following digraphs never lenite: *sg*, *sm*, *sp*, *st*. Lenition on **s** also behaves differently for certain nouns preceded by the definite article, here the **s** becomes **t-s** as in: *an t-Sultain* (September). This is also often determined by whether the word has changed case to become Dative or Genitive.

Slenderising: *Caoileachadh*
----------------------------

.. index:: slenderising

Certain consonants in Gaelic will change in pronunciation depending on whether they are accompanied by a broad or slender vowel. The letter **s**, for example, is pronounced similar to the English sound ‘s’ when combined with a broad vowel, as in *fios*, but similar to the English sound ‘sh’ when combined with a slender vowel, as in *a-nis*.

Words ending with broad vowels will sometimes change to ending with a slender vowel for grammatical reasons. For example, *balach*, the singular for boy, will become *balaich* in the plural. This change is known as slenderising (*caoileachadh*). It may take the form of a slender vowel being added to the existing vowels of the final syllable, as in *balaich*, or in the vowels changing completely, such as *eun*, for bird, which becomes *eòin* in the plural. As well as when certain nouns become plural, slenderising can also happen when a man’s name is used in the Vocative Case, i.e. *Dòmhnall* becomes *a Dhòmhnaill*, or for nouns used in the Genitive Case as when *cas*, foot, becomes *coise* as in *ball-coise*, football. These transformations are described in greater detail in sections on the specific grammar rules.
