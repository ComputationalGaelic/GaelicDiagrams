Vowel Groups: *Caol ri Caol ’s Leathann ri Leathann*
----------------------------------------------------

.. index:: vowels

Vowels in Gaelic divide into two groups: the *broad* vowels -- a, o, u -- and the *slender* vowels -- e, i.

In spelling a word, the vowels on either side of a consonant will normally be from the same group. This rule is known as *Caol ri Caol ’s Leathann ri Leathann* -- Broad with Broad and Slender with Slender -- and is one of the most basic spelling rules governing the language.

There are some exceptions to this as when the emphatic endings, *sa*, *-se* and *esan*, are applied: **example**.

And a few words such as *rudeigin* (something) but this is an anomaly that has arisen from what was originally two separate words joined by a hyphen, *rud-eigin*, becoming fused as a single item. This separation can be seen in related terms such as *tè-eigin* (some woman).

Vowels also appear in *short* and *long* forms. The short form of a vowels is written as the letter on its own -- a, e,i,o,u -- and the long form as the letter with an accent known as a *stràc* written over it ---- à, è, ì, ò, ù.

Consonant Groups
----------------

Gaelic does not require all of the consonants of the standard Latin alphabet. The letters j, k, q, v, w, x, y and z are not used. The *aibidil*, the Gaelic alphabet, consists of 18 letters, the five vowels and thirteen consonants: b, c, d, f, g, h, l, m, n, p, r, s, t.
