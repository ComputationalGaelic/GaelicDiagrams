Introduction

This guide provides a set of visual diagrams of Scottish Gaelic grammar. 

I have written this as a way of supporting my own learning of the language. In its current form, therefore, it should not be treated as definite or necessarily correct! One of my main reasons for producing this is that I am a visual thinker and often find it necessary to translate written grammar rules and explanations into a diagrammatic form. I hope that it can be of benefit to other visual learners.

For the most part, I have based the grammar rules on the explanations in Michel Byrne’s *Gràmar na Gàidhlig* published by Stòrlann and Andrew Cairnie’s online Gaelic Grammar at https://gaelicgrammar.org. I would recommend consulting these directly should you wish a more detailed or authoritative guide.

Where I have drawn on additional sources these have been included in a reference note at the end of each section.
