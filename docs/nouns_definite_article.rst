The Definite Article: *Alt Cinnteach*
=====================================

.. index:: definite article

Whereas English has both an indefinite and definite article, Gaelic only requires the definite article. The equivalent of “a dog” and “the dog” in Gaelic would be *cù* (dog) and *an cù* (the dog).

The definite article in Gaelic changes in different contexts depending on the spelling, gender, case and number of a word. Words beginning with **b**, **f**, **m** and **p** will use *am* rather than *an*: *am balach* (the boy), *am feòil* (the meat).  A singular feminine noun in the nominative case that has been lenited will use *a’*: *a’ bhò* (the cow). A singular masculine noun in the nominative case that begins with a vowel will use *an t-*: *an t-eilean* (the island). Plural nouns generally use *na*: *na balaich* (the boys).

These changes are described in greater detail in the sections that follow.
