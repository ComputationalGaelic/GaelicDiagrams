Grammatical Gender: *Gnè*

.. index:: nouns, gender


Like many languages, nouns in Gaelic are grouped by gender. The two genders in modern Gaelic are male and female, although a neuter gender existed in older Gaelic and the gender of some words may change across different dialects of Gaelic. 

In many cases the gender of a word will reflect conventional, social notions of gender but in other cases it may not. Masculine names and conventional masculine roles, such as ‘father’ and ‘brother’, are grammatically male, feminine names and roles such as ‘mother’ and ‘sister’ are grammatically female. For other words there may be no obvious relationship. The names of countries and languages are feminine, for example. Some words may be the opposite of what you might expect. *Boireannach*, one of the Gaelic words for woman, is grammatically masculine.

The main division of words be gender, however, is not related to social conventions but rather to the sound of the words. Words ending with **-ach**, **-adh**, **-an** and **-as** are mostly masculine. As *boireannach* ends with an **-ach** it is grammatically masculine. Names of occupations ending with **-r** and **iche** tend to be masculine. The endings **-ag**, **-achd** and **-id** are mostly feminine. At the most general level, words ending with a broad vowel (**a**, **o**, **u**) are masculine and words ending with a slender vowel (**e**, **i**) are feminine.
